===== # Security Policy and Guidelines =====
	+ CIA
	+ rules to follow CIA
		-+ High level : Data storage requirements, Security event procedures
		-+ Detailed : Appropriate Wi-fi usage, requirements for remote access
	+ Security policies ans: the "what" and "why"
		-+ technical security controls answer the "how"

==== Information security policies ====
	+ The big list of all security related policies
		-+ centralized resource for processes
	+ Compliance requirements
		-+ can be critical to an organization
		-+ MUST HAVE
	+ Detailed security procedure
		-+ What happens when.....?
			- virus is found
			- vulnerability exploited etc
	+ List of roles and responsibilites
		-+ So to know who to contact
	+ Must be ENFORCED

==== Acceptable use policy (AUP) ====
	+  acceptable use of company assets
	+ Covers many topics
		-+ Internet use
		-+ telephones
		-+ computers
		-+ mobile devices etc
	+ If someone is dismissed, these are the well-documented reasons why
		-+ limit legal liability

==== Business Continuity - COOP ====
	+ All systems fail
	+ still continue working
	+ Go back to PAPER
	+ Eg: Paper flight tickets during Crowdstrike outage
	+ Plan accordingly and document

==== Disaster recovery plan ====
	+ Be ready for many types of disaster
	+ Recovery location, data recovery method, application restoration, IT team and employee availability

===== Incident Response =====
	+ Policy to mitigate through some security incident
	+ Eg: Successful phishing,  DDoS / Botnet attack, Confidential information stolen
	+ need a teams that can work during such moments
		-+ Incident response team : specialized grp
		-+ IT security management : Corporate support
		-+ Compliance officers : Intricate knowledge of compliance rules
		-+ Technical staff 
		-+ user community

==== NIST SP800-61 ====
	+ National Institute of Standards andTechnology
		-+ NIST Special Publication 800-61 Revision 2
		-+ Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
	+ Include the Incident response lifecycle
		-+ Preparation
		-+ Detection and Analysis
		-+ Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
		-+ Post-incident Activity

==== Software development lifecycle (SDLC) ====
	+ Get from idea to app
	+ Many moving parts are involved
		-+ Customer requirements 
		-+ On schedule
		-+ Stay in budget
	+ Many ways to do so

{{./pasted_image_250806-002.png}}

	+ Waterfall : Linear
	+ Agile : Faster, Constant work, Many cycles before launch

==== Change Management ====
	+ How to make changes
		-+ Upgrade software, change firewall config, modify switch ports
	+ Common risk in the enterprise
	+ Often overlooked and ignored
	+ Have clear policies
		-+ Frequency, duration, installation process, fallback procedures
	+ Sometimes extremely difficult to implement : hard to change organizational culture

--------------------

===== # Security Standards =====
	+ A formal definition for using security technologies and processes
		-+ complete documentaion
		-+ everyone understands the expectations
	+ Can be written in house (unique to the environment)
	+ Many established standards
		-+ ISO (International Organization for Standardization)
		-+ NIST (National Institute of Standards andTechnology)

==== Password ====
	+ What makes a good password
		-+ differ from org to org
		-+ password complexity policy
	+ Define acceptable auth methods
	+ Create policies for secure password resets
		-+ avoid unauthorized resets and access
	+ Other pwd policies
		-+ pwd change frequency, secure pwd storage requirements, pwd manager options, etc.

==== Access Control ====
	+ control access to data
	+ which **information**, at what **time** and under which **circumstances**
	+ Determine how a user gets access
	+ Document how access may be removed
		-+ Security issue, expiration, contract renewals, etc.

==== Physical Security ====
	+ Rules and policies regarding physical security controls
	+ Granting physical access - different for employees vs visitors
	+ Define specific physical security systems
		-+ Electronic door locks, ongoing monitoring, motion detection, etc.
	+ Additional security concerns
		-+ Mandatory escorts, off-boarding, etc.

==== Encryption ====
	+ standards for encrypting and securing data
	+ Eg: Methods and techniques for Password Storage
	+ Data encryption minimums
		-+ Algortihms for data in use, data in transit, data at rest
		-+ different for each state

--------------------

===== # Security Procedures =====

=== Change Management ===
	+ A formal process for managing change
	+ avoid downtime, confusion and mistakes
	+ Process
		1. Determine the scope of the change
		2. Analyze the risk associated with the change
		3. Create a plan
		4. Get end-user approval
		5. Present the proposal to the change control board (If Present)
		6. Have a backout plan if the change does not work
		7. Document the changes

=== Onboarding ===
	+ Policies for bringing a new person
	+ IT agreements, Create accounts (with proper read and write permissions), Provide required IT hardware (Preconfigured laptops etc)

=== Offboarding ===
	+ leaving policy
	+ pre-planned
	+ What happens to the hardware, data in it, account (mostly deactivate)

=== Playbooks ===
	+ step by step guide for certain events (data breach, ransomware)
	+ Can be used to create automated activities
	+ Integrated with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

--------------------

===== # Monitoring and Revision =====
	+ Constant change is required
	+ Update security posture - Tighter change control, additional playbooks
	+ change to individual procedures - update playbooks, include additional checks
	+ New security concerns - new threats everyday

--------------------

===== # Governance Structure =====

=== Boards (Private Sector) ===
	+ a panel of specialists
	+ Sets the tasks or requirements for the committees
=== Committees ===
	+ Subject-matter experts
	+ Considers the input from the board
	+ Determines next steps for a topic at hand
	+ Presents the results to the board
=== Government Entities (Public Sector) ===
	+ A different kind of machines
	+ Legal concerns, administrative requirements, political issues
	+ Often open to the public
=== Centralized / Decentralized ===
	+ The source of the process and procedures
	+ Centralized governance is located in 1 location with a group of decision makers
	+ Decentralized governance spreads the decision-making process around to other individuals or locations

--------------------

===== # External Consideration =====

=== Regulatory ===
	+ External regulations are often mandated
		-+ security processes are usually a foundational considerations
		-+ logging, data storage, data protection, and retention
	+ Sarvanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
		-+ The public company accounting reform and investor protection act of 2002
		-+ Regualtions in terms of finances
		-+ In respect ti IT dept, it says how to store and protect financial stuff
	+ The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA)
		-+ Extensive healthcare standards for storage, use and transmission of health care information

=== Legal ===
	+ The security team is often tasked with legal reponsibilities
	+ security breach notification (varies geographically)
	+ CLoud computing makes this challenging

=== Industry ===
	+ Every industry require specific security considerations
	+ Eg: Electrical power and public utilites should be isolated and have protected system controls
	+ Eg: MEdical stuff should have highly secure data storage and access logs

=== Geographical security ===
	+ security regulations are related to where they matter
	+ Local 
	+ National
	+ Global

--------------------

===== # Roles and responsibilties for system & data =====
	+HIgh level data relationships

	1. Data Owner - Accountable for specific data, often a senior officer
		a. Eg: VP of sales owns the customer relationship data
		b. Eg: Treasurer owns the financial information
	2. Data Controller - Manages the purpose and means by which personal data is processed
	3. Data Processor - Processes data on behalf of the data controller
		a. often a 3rd party or a different group
		b. Eg: Payroll department (data controller defines payroll amounts and timeframes
		c. Payroll company (data processor) processes payroll and stores employee information
	4. Data Custodian / Steward
		a. Responsible for data accuracy, privacy, and security
		b. Works directly with the data
			1. Associates senstivity labels to the data
			2. Ensures compliance with any applicable laws and standards
			3. Manages the access rights to the data
			4. Implements security controls
