===== # Risk Identification =====
	+ Manage potential risk
	+ Qualify internal and external threats
	+ Risk analysis helps plan for contingencies

--------------------

===== # Risk Assessment =====
	+ Not all risks requires constant evalution
	+ Or it might be required to always assess the amount of risk

=== One-time ===
	+ The assessment may be part of a one-time project
	+ Eg: Comapny acquisition, new equipment installation, unique new security threat etc.

=== Continuous ===
	+ May be part of an existing process
	+ Change control requires a risk assessment as part of the change.

=== Ad hoc (for this) ===
	+ As in "for this...purpose only"
	+ Perform risk assessment when situtaion requires
	+ Eg: CEO learns about a new attack type -> Wants to know if the org is protected from this new attack 
	+ A committee is created and the risk assessment proceeds
		-+ Once the assessment is complete, the committee is disbanded
		-+ There may not be a need to investigate this specific risk again

=== Recurring ===
	+ The evaluation occurs on standard intervals
	+ Eg: An internal assessment that is performed every three months at the beginning of the quarter
	+ Can be Mandated
		-+ Required by certain organization
		-+ Some legal requirements will mandate an assessment
		-+ PCI DSS requires annual risk assessment

--------------------

===== # Risk Analysis =====

==== Qualitative ====
	+ Compare Risk factor to many criteria
	+ Each criteria will have it's own significance
	{{./pasted_image_250807.png}}

==== Quantitative ====
	+ Deals with actual numbers
	+ ARO - Annualized Rate of Occurance
		-+ How likely is it that a hurricane will it? 
			- Low in Gujarat
			- High in Florida
	+ Asset Value (AV) 
		-+ The value of the asset to the org
		-+ Includes the cost of the asset, the effect on company sales, potential regulatory fines, etc.
	+ Exposure factor (EF)
		-+ The percentage of the value lost due to an incident
		-+ Losing a quarter of the value is 0.25
		-+ Losing the entire asset is 1.0

	+ Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
		-+ Monetary loss if a SINGLE event occurs
		-+ SLE = Asset Value (AV) x Exposure factor (EF)
		-+ Laptop stolen = $1000 (AV) * 1.0 (EF) = $1000 (SLE)

	+ Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)
		-+ Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO) x SLE
		-+ Seven laptops stolen a year (ARO) * $1000 (SLE) = $7000 (ALE)

	+ The business impact can be more than monetary
		-+ The data in laptop was more valuable than the laptop
		-+ Quantitative vs Qualitative

==== Impact ====
	+ Life (most imp)
	+ PRoperty
	+ Safety
	+ Finance

==== Likelihood and probability ====
	+ Risk likelihood
		-+ A qualitative measure of the risk
	+ Risk Probability
		-+ A quantitaive measure of the risk
		-+ A statistical measurement
		-+ based on historical performance

==== Risk Appetite and tolerance ====
	+ A broad description of risk-taking deemed acceptable
	+ The amt of accepted risk before taking any action to reduce that risk

	+ Risk appetite posture
		-+ Qualitative description for readiness to take risk
		-+ Conservative, neutral and expansionary
	+ Risk tolerance
		-+ Larger from risk appetite
		-+ Risk appetite is all about the risk you are absolutely okay to take
		-+ tolerance on the other hand is about the risk you can take but no more.
		-+ Eg: if speed limit is 55 that is risk appetite, but one will not be fined for driving at 58mph or 60mph, that is risk tolerance

==== Risk register ====
	+ Complete document of risk associated with every plan of an org
	+ Key risk indicators - Identify risks that could impact the org
	+ Risk owners - responsible for managing that risk
	+ Risk threshold - the cost of mitigation =< value gained by mitigation

--------------------

===== # Risk Management strategies =====

=== Transfer ===
	+ Move the risk to anothe party
	+ Eg: Buy some cybersecurity insurance

=== Accept ===
	+ Accept the risk
	+ Often the usual course

=== Accept with exemption ===
	+ A security policy or regulation cannot be followed.
	+ May be based on available security controls, size of org, total assetss, etc
	+ Exemption may need approval

=== Accept with exception ===
	+ Internal security policies are not applied
	+ Eg: Monthly security updates must be applied within 3 calendar days. But a monthly update cause a critical software package to crash
	+ Hence an exception is made to the update timeframe (wait more than 3 days)

=== Avoid ===
	+ Stop participating in a high risk activity
	+ This effectively removes the risk

=== Mitigate ===
	+ Decrease the risk level
	+ Invest in securty systems
	+ Eg: Invest in NGFW when there is a risk from internet

==== Risk reporting ====
	+ A formal document
		-+ Identifies risk
		-+ Detailed info for each risk
	+ Usually created for senior management
		-+ for them to make decisions regarding resources, budgeting, additional security tasks
	+ Commonly includes critical and emerging risks

--------------------

===== # Business Impact Analysis =====

=== Revovery Time Objective (RTO) ===
	+ Timeframe to know  hoe long it is before "Get up and running"
	+ Get back to a particular service level
	+ Eg: You're not up and running until the database and web server are operational

=== Recovery Point Objective (RPO) ===
	+ Point in time when an org can say they are up and running, but htey need something to get to that point
	+ Eg: A company can say they are up and running if they have 12 months of customer data
	+ this 12 months of customer data is called RPO

=== Mean time to Repair (MTTR) ===
	+ Avg time required to fix an issue
	+ This includes time spent diagnosing the problem
	+ an important metric for determining the cost and time associated with unplanned outages

=== Mean time between Failures (MTBF) ===
	+ the time between outages
	+ Can be used as a prediction or calculated based on historical performance
	+ Total uptime / number of breakdowns
	+ Statistically plan for possible outages
