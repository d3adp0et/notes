===== # Data Types =====
	1. Regulated
		a. Managed by a third party
		b. Govenrment laws and statutes are to be kept in mind
		c. Eg: If an org stores credit card info - they are to follow payment card industry standards and certain laws
	2. Trade secret
		a. An org's secret formulas
		b. Often unique to an organization hence needs to protected
	3. Intellectual property
		a. It may be visible to public - like code, art, movies etc
		b. They are copyright or trademark restricted
	4. Legal Information
		a. A mix for public and private data
		b. Court records, documentation, Judge and attorney information etc. are public.
		c. PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and other sensitive details are to be held Private.
		d. Hence these informations are usually stored in many DIFFERENT locations.
	5. Financial Information
		a. Internal company financial details - PRIVATE
		b. Customer financials - PRIVATE
		c. Payment records - PRIVATE
		d. Credit card data, bank records, etc. - ALL PRIVATE!!!
	6. Human-readable
		a. Eg: Spreadsheets, text etc.
	7. Non-human readable
		a. Eg: Encoded data, Barcodes, Images
	8. Some formats are a hybrid of 6 and 7
		a. Eg: CSV, XML, JSON, etc.

--------------------

===== # Data Classification =====
	+ Not all data has same level of security invloved
		-+ Additional permissions
		-+ A different viewing process
		-+ Restricted network access
	+ **License tag numbers** are public but **health records** are private

	1. Propritary
		a. Data that is property of an organization
		b. May also include trade secrets
		c. Unique
	2. PII - Personally Identifiable Information
		a. Data to identify an individual 
		b. Eg: Name, DOB, biometrics etc.
	3. PHI - Protected Health Information
		a. Health information associated with an individual
		b. Eg: Health status, health care records, payments for health care, etc


	4. Sensitive
		a. Intellectual property, PII, PHI
	5. Confidential
		a. very sensitive, must be approved to view
	6. Public / Unclassified
		a. No restrictions on viewing the data
	7. Private / Classified / Restricted
		a. Restricted access. may require an NDA
	8. Critical
		a. Data should always be available

--------------------

===== # States of Data =====

==== Data at rest ====
	+ Data on storage devices
		-+ Hard drives, SSD etc
	+ Encrypt the data
		-+ Full disk encryption
		-+ Database encryption
		-+ File-level  OR folder-level encryption
	+ Apply permissions
		-+ Access control lists
		-+ Only authorized users can access the data

==== Data in transit / motion ====
	+ Data transmitted over a network
	+ Less protected that data at rest
		-+ Multiple failure points: switeches, routers, devices
	+ Network based protection is required
		-+ Firewall, IPS
	+ Transport Encryption
		-+ TLS
		-+ IPSec

==== Data in use ====
	+  Data is actively being processed IN MEMORY
		-+ System RAM, CPU registers and cache
	+ The data is almost always decrypted
	+ Attractive to attackers, as they can pick the decrypted information out of RAM
	+ Eg: Target Corp. breach - November 2013
		-+ 110 milion credit card details stolen
		-+ They had data in transit and data in use encryptions
		-+ Attackers picked the credit card numbers out of the point-of-sale RAM

==== Data Sovereignty ====
	+ Data that resides in a country is subject to the laws of that country
	+ Eg: Legal monitoring, court orders, etc.
	+ Laws may prohibit where data is stored
		-+ GDPR (general data protection regulation) has many such rules.
		-+ Data collected on EU citizens must be stored in the EU.
		-+ A complex mesh of tech and legalities.
	+ Compliance laws may even prohibit moving data out of the country

--------------------
==== Note: ====
Geolocation provides location details through many different ways (802.11, mobile providers, GPS etc) which can be used to manage data access.
	+ prevents access from other countries (Eg: streaming)
	+ Permit enhanced access when inside a building
--------------------

===== # Methods to secure Data =====

==== Geographc Restrictions ====
	+ Network location
		-+ identify based in IP subnet
		-+ Can be difficult with mobile devices
	+ Geolocation - determine a user's location
		-+ GPS - mobile devices, very accurate
		-+ 802.11 wireless, less accurate
		-+ IP address, not very accurate
	+ Geofencing
		-+ Automatically allow or restrict access when the user is in a particular location.
		-+ Don't allow this app to run unless you're near the office.

--------------------

==== Encryption ====
	+ Plain Text → Encryption → Cypher Text → Decryption → Plain Text
	+ Confusion: Encrypted data is drastically different than the plaintext

==== Hashing ====
	+Message Digest, Fingerprint
	+ verification
	+ Authentication, non-repudiation, integrity

==== Obfuscation ====
	+ memfrob
	+ take perfectly readable code and turn it into nonsens
		-+ the developer keeps the readable code and gives you the obfuscated one
		-+ both perform the same way though
	+ helps prevent rge search for security holes

==== Masking ====
	+ Hide some part of the data
	+ Eg: only last 4 digits of card number are visible
	+ substituting, shuffling, encrypting, masking out, etc

==== Tokenization ====
	+ Replace snesitive data with a non-sensitive placeholder
	+ Common with credit card processing through phone (Apple Pay)
	+ the og data and token are not mathematically related (no encryption overhead)

	{{./pasted_image_250805-003.png}}

	+ Many tokens are provided at once

==== Segmentation ====
	+ Have many different data sources
	+ no single point of failure
	+ apply different security at different databases

==== Permission Restrictions ====
	+ different policies
	+ password policies
	+ authenticatyion factor policies
	+ Permissions after login
