==== # Application ====
=== 1. Memory Injection ===
	a. malware runs in memory, where many processes are present
		1. DLLs, Threads, Buffer, Memory management functions
	b. DLL Injection
	{{./pasted_image_250813-001.png}}

=== 2. Buffer Overflow ===
	a. a really useful bufferoverflow is **repeatable**

=== 3. Race Conditions ===
	a. a programming conundrum
	b. TOCTOU -> time-of check to time-of-use  attack -> when an application is used using the results of a relatively older system check (a process might have occured then)
		1. Eg: Deposits to the account are immediate and the withdrawals are not
=== 4. Software Update ===
	a. have backup if something goes wrong in update
	b. trustful sources
	c. Automatic updates
		1. Eg: Attackers gained acces to solarwinds development systes and added their own code to the next update
		2. hence gaining access to many govn agencies and companies

==== # Operating systems ====
	a. keep it updated - monthly or on demand
	b. more complex - more security issues
	c. Eg: windows has patch tuesdays - 2nd tuesday of every month
	d. Eg: May 9 2023 - Nearly 50 security patches by Windows
		1. 8 elevation of privilege vulnerabilities
		2. 4 security feature bypass vuln
		3. 12 remote code execution vuln
		4. 8 info disclosure vuln
		5. 5 denial of service vuln
		6. 1 spoofing vuln

==== # Web Based ====
=== 1. SQL Injection (SQLi) ===
	1. Eg: Website code ->  "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '<enter username>'";
			   Code Injection -> "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name = '<enter username>//**' OR '1' = '1**//'";            'OR '1' = '1 is the injected code along with the username (which is always true)

=== 2. Cross site scripting (XSS) ===
	{{./pasted_image_250814.png}}
	a. Non-persistent (reflected) XSS attack
		1. Website allows JS scripts to run in user input
		2. attacker emails a link that takes advantage of this vuln - runs a script that send creds/session IDs/cookies to the attacker
		3. the attacker uses these to steal victim's info without their knowledge
	b. Persistent XSS attack
		1. attacker posts a message to a social netowork
		2. It is persistent -> Everyone gets the payload
	c. Eg: June 20177, Aaron Guzman
		1. when authenticating with subaru, users get a token that never expires
		2. A valid token allowed any service request
			a. Even adding your email addr to someone else's acc - giving access to someone else's car
		3. Web front end included and XSS vuln
			a. A user clicka mal link and you have their access token
	d. Protection:
		1. do not click link
		2. disable or control JS
		3. keep browser and app updated

==== # Hardware vulnerabilities ====
	1. many riskslike IoT
	2. Firmware - OS of hardware devices OR something that communicates between software and hardware
	3. Eg: Trane Comfortlink II thermostats : control the temp from your phone
		a. Trane notified of 3 vuln - 2 patched after an year and 1 after 2 years
	4. EOL notice (end of life)
		a. after EOL comes EOSL (end of service life) - that may have permium cost support options
	5. Legacy Platform
		a. device with old OS, app or middleware
		b. may have EOL software
		c. may require extra security - if cannot remove immediately

# Virtualization
	1. same security as physical OSs
	2. VM Escape: break out of one VM and and interact with another VM or host OS or hardware
		a. great control
		b. Pwn2Own competition - march 2017
