====== 4.6 Identity and access management ======
Created Wednesday 06 August 2025

=== # Identity and Access Management (IAM) ===
	+ starts with giving access and ends with revoking access
	+ Access control
	+ Authentication and authorization
	+ track resource access - governance
	
=== # Provisioning and de-provisioning user accounts ===
	+ hiring / transfers / promotions / job separation
	+ core to the IAM process

=== # Permisiion assignments ===
	+ limited permission - enough to do the job (least privilage)
	+ storage and files can be private to the user
	+ no privilage access to the OS

=== # Identity Proofing ===
	+ background check
	+ resolution
	+ attestation / verification (passport / dl / in-person)

=== # Gaining access ===
	+ the process of gaining access to a resource
	+ login etc (AAA)

=== # Single Sign-on (SSO) ===
	+ Eg: DUO gives SSO
	+ OpenID
	+ full access to all resources after single sign on for a limited time (say 24hrs)

=== # Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) - 389 port no ===
	+ Authentication protocol
	+ for accessing large directories over an IP network
	+ An organized set of records, like a phone directory
	+ X.500 specification was written by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
	+ DAP (early version) ran on OSI Protocol Stack
	+ LDAP is the protocol that is used to query and update an X.500 directory
		-+ used in WIndows Active Directory, Apple OpenDirectory, Novell eDirectory etc

=== # Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) ===

=== # OAuth (Spotify + alexa) ===

=== # Federation (NEU + O'Reily) ===

=== # Interoperatbility ===
	+ when making final decision on what to use, see that all the components work well together, i.e., they are interoperable

--------------------

==== # Access Control ====

=== 1. Least Privilege (ala carte) ===
	a. exactly what they need to perform the job
	b. no admin access
	c. limits scope to malware
=== 2. Mandatory Access Control (MAC) - classification on object ===
	a. based on security clearance levels
	b. Label: Confidential; Secret; top secret
	c. Predefined rules: admin decides
=== 3. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) - subject makes classfication ===
	a. Person who creates data decides who has the access to the data
	b. Used in OSs - like linux
	c. like in google docs/sheets etc
	d. weak security
=== 4. Role-based access Control (RBAC) - classification on subject ===
	a. depends on role in org
	b. grps: manager; director; team lead; project manager
	c. admin decides - makes grps and adds users to grps
	d. windows OS - groups
=== 5. Rule-based access control - subject follows rules made for object ===
	a. generic term for following rules
	b. admin makes rules
	c. every object has associated rules- users need to comply
	d. Eg: gain access b/w 9am to 5pm ; form can only be filled in chrome browser
=== 6. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) ===
	a. can consider many parameters
	b. kind of next generation
	c. parameters: resource information, IP Address, Time of day, desired action, relationship to the data, etc.
=== 7. Time-of-day restriction ===
	a. access depending on time (even time zone)
	b. work with other controls

--------------------

==== # Multifactor Aunthentication ====

=== Authentication Factors ===
	1. Something you know - passwords/PIN; memorize
	2. Something you have - smart card ID, USB security key, phone(sms etc)
	3. Something you are - biometrics; used in conjunction with others
	4. Somewhere you are - using location; ip address(IPv4 and not IPv6); GPS; 802.11 network

--------------------

==== # Password Security ====
	+ high entropy
	+ password age / expiration
	+ password managers: bitlocker (encrypted; MFA)
	+ passwordless: facial recognition, security key etc
	+ passwordless should not be primary

	+ Just-in-time permissions
		-+ temp access
		-+ Eg: techinician having admin rights when fixing a issue
			- request issue from clearinhouse
