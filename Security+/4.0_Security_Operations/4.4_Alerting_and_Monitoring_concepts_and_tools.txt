====== 4.4 Alerting and Monitoring concepts and tools ======
Created Wednesday 06 August 2025

==== # Security Monitoring ====
	+ Always monitor
	+ logins, services, access
	+ React to security event
	+ status dashboards 

==== # What to monitor - Computing Resources ====
	+ Systems
		-+ Authentication
		-+ Server Monitoring
	+ Applications
		-+ Availability
		-+ Data transfer - traffic
		-+ Security notifications between devs and manufacturers
	+ Infrastructure
		-+ Remote access systems
		-+ Firewall and IPS reports

--------------------

==== # Actiities ====
=== Log Aggregation - SIEM ===
	+ centralized reporting
	+ corelation and stats

=== Alerting ===
	+ real time notification: large file transfer, inc in auth errors
	+ actionable data: keep the right peeps informed
	+ notification methods: SMS, mail, SOC

=== Scanning ===
	+ Constant scanning
	+ OSs, drivers, apps, anomalies

=== Reporting ===
	+ actionable reports- playbooks kinda
	+ status info
	+ Ad hoc info summary - future problems 

=== Archiving ===
	+ access to data is critical
	+ may have a mandate

=== Alert response and remediation/validation ===
	+ Quarantine
	+ Alert tuning - good accuracy

--------------------

==== # Tools ====
=== Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) ===
	+ Managed by NIST 
	+ Allows many different sec tools in market to identify and act on the same criteria
	+ manage diff vuln between diff OS
	+ automation

=== Benchmarks ===
	+ best practices
	+ popular benchmarks - Center of Internet Security (CIS)

=== Agent / Agentless ===
	+ check to see if the device is compliant
	+ Agent: always on always running, regular updates
	+ Agentless: performs check then disappears, regular updates not required, no inform/alert when not run

=== SIEM - Security Information and Event Management ===
	+ log collection
	+ aggregation
	+ long term storage
	+ Data correlation
	+ Forensice analysis

=== AntiVirus / Anti Malware ===

=== Data Loss Prevention (DLP) ===
	+ look for and block any data you do not want to run
	+ Stop Data leakage
	+ DLP can be used on endpoints and cloud based systems (email, storage etc)

=== SNMP - Simple Network management protocol ===
	+ A database of data - Management Information Base (MIB)
	+ the database contains OIDs - Object Identifiers
	+ poll devices over udp/161

		{{./pasted_image_250824.png}}
		
	+ Requests stats form a device - server, firewall, workstation, switc, router, etc
	+ Poll Devices at fixed intervals
	+ make graphs

	+ SNMP Traps
		-+ configured on the monitoring devices - communicated over udp/162
		-+ Set a threshold for alerts
			- If the no of errors increases by 5 -> send a trap
			- this trap will make the monitoring system react immediately, hence sending alerts

=== NetFlow ===
	+ gather traffic stats from all traffic flows
	+ netflow is a std collection method - many products and options
	+ Probe and Collectors are used
		-+ Probe watches the network comms
		-+ Summary records are sent to the collector
	+ then make report (3rd party - Eg: solarwinds)

=== Vuln Scanners ===
	+ no exploits are performed
	+ port scanners
	+ Passive
	+ A lot of info -  find good info
