====== 4.5 How to enhance security ======
Created Wednesday 06 August 2025


==== # Firewall ====
=== 1. Network Based Firewall ===
	a. Filter traffic by port number (Traditional) or application (NGFW)
	b. NGFW - layer 7
		1. Application layer gateway
		2. stateful multilayer inspection
		3. deep packet inspection
=== 2. Firewall Rules ===
	a. logic goes from top-to-bottom
	b. Specific rules are on top and general rules are below
	c. Implicit Deny - deny anything that has no rule governing it
	d. Access Control Lists (ACLs)
		1. allow/disallow list
=== 3. Screened Subnet ===
	a. only area of the network where internet access is allowed

--------------------

==== # IDS/ IPS ====
=== Rules ===
	a. Signature Based - matches signature data
	b. Anomaly Based - identifies mal patterns
	c. many rules
	d. rule group customization
	e. removing false positive / Alert "noise" takes precision and time

--------------------

==== # Web Filtering ====
=== 1. Content Filtering ===
	+ Corporate control of inbound and outbound data
	+ Control of inapt content
		-+ NSFW
		-+ Parental Control

=== 2. URL Scanning ===
	a. URI - Uniform resource identifier
	b. allow list / block list
	c. managed by category: auction / hacking / malware / travel / recreation etc
	d. often integrated with NGFW

=== 3. Agent Based (mobile) ===
	a. does not have to be in a firewall monitored network
	b. mobile - users can be located anywhere
	c. client software on user's device
	d. cloud based updates

=== 4. Proxies ===
	a. Forward Proxies

== + Block Rules ==
	-+specific rules
	-+ category rules
== + Reputation ==
	-+ Agood rep is allowed and vice versa
	-+ Risk category: Trustworthy, Low risk, Medium risk, Suspicious, Hish risk
	-+ Automated and manual

=== 5. DNS Filtering ===
	a. DNS Lookup
	b. DNS is updated with real time threat intelligence
	c. harmful sites are resolved
	d. this is not only for web pages, any dns lookup

--------------------

==== # Operating Systems Security ====
=== Active Directory ===
	+ WINDOWS
	+ A database of computers, user accounts, file shares, printers, groups and more
	+ Manage Authentication
	+ Centralized access control
		-+ resource access on the baseis of groups and users
	+ ued by help desk
		-+ reset passwords, add / remove accounts

=== Group Policy ===
	+ An overlay of security policy over AD
	+ used to manage computers or users
		-+ local and domain policy
		-+ Group policy management editor - a central console
			- Login scripts
			- Network configs - such as QoS
			- Security parameters
	+ Comprehensive control
		-+ many options

=== Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) ===
	+ security patches for the linux kernel
		-+ Adds mandatory access control (MAC) to linux [only admins can assign user access]
		-+ traditional linux has discretionary access control (DAC)
	+ Limits application access
		-+ Least privilege
		-+ A potential breach will have a limited scope
		-+ Open Source

--------------------

==== # Implementation of Secure Protocols ====
unencrypted protocols: Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP
=== Protocol Selection ===
	+ use secure protocol
	+ one which is encrypted
	+ SSH instead of Telnet
	+ HTTP(80) instead of HTTPS(443)
	+ IMAPS instead if IMAP
	+ FTP instead of SFTP

=== Port Selection ===
	+ use secure port (443 instead of 80)

=== Transport Method ===
	+ encryption of network
	+ 802.11 Wireless
		-+ Open access point: no transport level encryption
		-+ WPA3: All user data is encrypted
	+ VPN

--------------------

==== # Email Security ====
	+ email spoofing
=== Mail Gateway (maybe in a screened subnet)		RECIEVER ===
	+ checks src validity

=== Sender Policy Framework (SPF)		SENDER ===
	+ when incharge for an email
	+ These are allowed to send emails from our behalf
	+ sender configures a list of all servers authorized to send emails for a domain
	+ the list is added to a DNS TXT record
		-+ for the recieving mail servers to see if incoming mail really did come form a authorized host

=== Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) ===
	+ Digital signature added to the process of transporting and not message
	+ Mail server digitally signs all outgoing mail
		-+ the public key is in the DKIM TXT record
	+ look at the header and find DKIM signature
		-+ recieving server will query DNS server and find the TXT record with DKIM Signature to validate mail

=== Doamin-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformation (DMARC) ===
	+ an extension of DKIM and SPF
	+ The domain owner decides what receiving email servers should do with emails not validating using SPF and DKIM
		-+ This policy is written into a DNS TXT record
		-+ Accept all, send to spam or reject the email
	+ It also sends compliance report to email administrator
		-+ a summary of emails that were legit and not legit
	+ also added to the DNS server as a TXT record

	EG:
	{{./pasted_image_250907-001.png}}
		1. id = DMARC1
		2. if not authentidcated = quarantine
		3. reporting engine = dmarcreports@example.com

--------------------

==== # Monitoring Data ====
=== File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) ===
	+ Monitor important OS and application files
	+ monitor the files that should never change
	+ FIM identifies when any change occurs
		1. Windows - SFC (System File Checker)
		2. Linux - Tripwire
		3. Many host-based IPS can do so too!

=== Data Loss Prevention ===
	+ traffic monitoring
	+ on ur computer: Endpoint DLP; Data in use
	+ on ur network: Data in motion
	+ on ur server: Data at rest

=== USB Blocking ===
	+ Eg: "agent.btz" ; worm virus that replicates

=== Cloud Based DLP ===
	+ similar to local just cloud

=== DLP and email ===
	+ critical risk vector
	+ checks both inbound and outbound emails
	+ Inbound rules: Block keywords, Identify imposters, quarantine email messages
	+ Outbound rules: Fake wire transfer, W-2 transmissions (like SSN) , employee information
	+ Eg: In 2016, outbound transfer of spreadsheet that appeared empty but had PII of 36000 boeing employees in hidden fields

--------------------

==== # Endpoint Security ====
	+ personal devices
	+ Defense in depth
	
=== + Control at the edge ===
	-+ link to outside (like internet)
	-+ static firewall rules
=== + Access Control ===
=== + Posture Assessment ===
	-+ Done on all devices
	-+ looking for any part of the device that is not up to date to latest security posture
	-+ perform health check
		- trust?
		- AV?
		- corpo apps installed?
		- does not depend on OS
	-+ 3 ways:
		1. Persistent Agent - permanent installation; constant monitoring
		2. Dissolved Agent - terminates after use
		3. Agentless NAC - Integrated with AD; checks @ login and logoff; AD HOC

	-+ if failed - quarantine now and redo test later

+ Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)
	-+ lightweight
	-+ Behaviour analysis / ML
	-+ Root cause analysis
	-+ Response to the threat- isolate system; quarantine threat; rollback

+ Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
	-+ better EDR
	-+ XDR can interpret data from multiple systems simultaneously
	-+ Endpoints, network and cloud
	-+ uses behaviour analytics - watch for anything unusual
